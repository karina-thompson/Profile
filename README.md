I am... Melbourne born and bred, just trying to find my way in life. I am embarking on a new journey leanrning how to code, which is scary and exciting!

Things I love:
- Being active
- Reading
- Festivals
- Hugs
- Coffee

Here's a random meme (**not showing how I'm feeling at all!**)

My goals and dreams... are to be happy, to find fulfilling work and to travel more!
